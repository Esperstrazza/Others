# Others

This is where I put smaller projects.
General Paint and ten2 are websites I made with Xampp while I was learning how to code, made with JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
Both including a shop, an area restricted to registered members, a way to upload new products to sell, the necessary connection to the server.

CodSd is sudoku made with C# and played in a browser.
